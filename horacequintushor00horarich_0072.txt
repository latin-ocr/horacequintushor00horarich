TO THE POET TIBULLUS

ΤΗΕ FOURTH LETTER OF THE F IRST BOOK

Albius Tibullus was a poet of some distinction, a iriend of
Horace and about ten years his junior. When this letter was
written he was a little over 30. Tibullus wrote heroic verse,
but devoted himself especially to the production of elegies
wherein he '¹ wept over tender loves ¹¹. He also celebrated in
song the merits of Delia and later ot Nemesis, persons whom we
would not now consider either wise or good.

Horace seems to have been quite intimate with him. He
addressed an Ode to him, 1, 33, in which he protests rather
facetiously at the serious way in which the elegiae poet took his
love affairs. The opening and closing lines of this Ode have been
translated thus by Martin:

Nay, Albius, a truce to this sighing and grieving!
ls Glycera worth all this torture ol brain?

Why flatter her, lachrymose elegies weaving,
Because she is false lor a youthfuller swain 2

Such caprices bath Venus, who, rarely propitious,
Delights in her letters of iron to bind

Those pairs whom she sees, with a pleasure malicious.
Unmatched both in fortune, and figure, and mind.

l myself, woo'd by one that was truly a jewel,
ln thraldom was held, which l cheerlully bore,
By hat vulgar thing, Myrtale, though she was cruel
As waves that indent the Calabrian shore.

Tibullus was a knight and the possessor ol property in the
country. For a time he served in the army under Messala, to
whose literary circle he belonged. lt may be gathered from his
verse, says Wilkin, that he was '¹ a gentle, tender, melancholy
soul.'' l-le died young.
