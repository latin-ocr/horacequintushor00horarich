The Third Letter of the Second Book 83

The part therefore, which belongs to old age may
not be ascribed to the youth; nor that ol manhood to
the boy; we must never wander from what is suitable
and akin to each period.

An action is either represented on the stage, or is

related to have happened. The things that enter by the ee n ue

ear affect the mind less than those which fall under
the faithful scrutiny of the eyeS, when the spectator sees

Segnius inritant animos demissa per aurem
Quam quae sunt oculis subiecta fidelibus et quae
lpse sibi tradit spectator:

ior himself. You must not however, show upon the
stage things which are more fit to be acted behind the
scenes; and you should remove many actions from view
which an eloquent actor will soon relate to his audi-
ence. Do not let Medea butcher her sons in the
presence of the 35'spectators; or impious Atreus cook
human flesh up& the stage3 nor let Progne be trans-
formed into a bird, or Cadmus into a serpent. What-
ever of this kind you set before me, l can not believe
and so l hate it.

Α play, which would be in demand, and after one
representation be called for again, should not be shorter
, nor longer than five acts. Nor let a god be intro-
duced, unless a puzzling difficulty occurs worthy a god
to unravel; nor let there be more than three speakers
in one scene.
