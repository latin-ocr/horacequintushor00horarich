26 Horace .Î‡ Quintus Horatius Flaccus

So I say, MaecenaS, when a man has found out that
the life he once quitted is preferable to that which he
has later chosen, let him return, and take up that which
he has left. lt is right that every man should be
measured by his own standard and rule.

Metiri se quemque suo modulo ac pede verum est.
