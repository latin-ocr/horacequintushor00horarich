 

Et ni

Posces ante diern librum cum lumine. si non

Intendes animum studiis et rebus honestis,
Invidia vel amore vigil torquebere.

Ep. l, Ζ

Unless you light your lamp ere dawn and read
Some who! some book that high resolves may breed,
You'll find your sleep go from you, and will loss
Upon your pillow‚ envious, lovesick. cross.

Conington
