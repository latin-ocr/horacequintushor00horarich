72 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

writers are happy and greatly pleased with themselves.
ll the critic is silent, the happy creatures are just as
pleased over what they think the critic has said.

Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina; verum
Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur et ultro,
Si taceas, laudant quidquid scripsere beati.

, But if one wishes to write a genuine poem, he will
. assume the spirit of an honest critic; he will dare to
n· remove all words which are lacking in clearness‚ or have
θ little force. He will happily revive other words which
⁶ have been long dead lor the people, and will bring to
light proper and foreible terms which were in use at the
time of Cathegus and Cato, but are now lost in the
dust and ruin of the years. He will also adopt new
words, as his need requires; forcible and clear, like a
pure and limpid stream, he will pour his treasure out
and enrich Latium with a more copious language; he
will prune the luxuriant and polish the. rough with
salutary art. He will seem to write with the utmost
ease, even while he labors most; like a dancer who
skilfully plays now the part of a satyr, now that of a
clumsy Cyclops.

But who would be a poet as things are now 9 l would
myself rather be accounted a foolish and dull writer,
while my follies please me or at least escape my

notice, than be wise and have to suffer for it.

Praetulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri,
Durn mea delectent mala me vel denique fallant,
Quam sapere et tingi.
