TO JUL1US FLORUS

ΤΗΕ SECOND LETTER OF ΤΗΕ SECOND BOOK

Julius Florus to whom this letter is addressed is the same
young man to whom Horace wrote Epistle Ι. 3. a few years
before. Florus was again away from Rome in the train of
Tiberius Nem. lt appears that before leaving he had asked
Horace to send him letters and verseS. Horace begins the
present Epistle with very elaborate excuses tor not having writ-
ten as requested. Ηε tells a story and applies it, with a sketch
of his own career. The burden of the latter part of the letter
is the sad state of things among the versemakers of Rome.
Horace says he is tired of contemporary poets and poetry.

The excellent Davidson says: ”This is none of his
meanest pieces; it is full of excellent precepts for Poetry and
Morality and all interspersed with judicious criticism and the
finest Turns of Satire.''
