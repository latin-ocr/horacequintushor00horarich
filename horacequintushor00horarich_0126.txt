54 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

your youth departs. When, thumbed by the hands of
the vulgar, you begin to get soiled, you will soon
become the food of moths‚ or will be banished to
Utica, or sent in a bundle to Spain. l, your disregarded

icat, monitor, will then laugh; like the angry peasant who

pushed his refractory ass over the precipice. For who

5¹¹, tries to save a fool against his will?

. . . quis enim invitum servare laboret?

¹ This also is in store for you: some snuffling old
pedant in the city suburbs will use you to teach boys
the elements of language!

When some temperate evening gathers more hearers
about you, you may tell thern that I, born of a freed-
man and of low fortune, have soared beyond my nest;
that what they take from me on account of birth they
may add on account of merit; that l was received
among the great oi Rome, both statesmen and gen-
erals; that l was of short stature, prematurely gray,
fond of the sun, of quick temper, yet easily appeased.
li any one chance to ask my age, let him know that I
had seen 44 Decembers when Lollius accepted Lepidus
as his colleague.

Ut quantum generi demas, virtutibus addas3
Me primis urbis belli placuisse domique,
Corporis exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum,
Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.
Forte meum siquis te percontabitur aevum,

Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembris
Conlegam Lepidum quo dixit Lollius anno.
