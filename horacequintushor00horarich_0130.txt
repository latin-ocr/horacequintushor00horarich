58 Horace: Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Si meliora dies, ut vina, poemata reddit;
Scire velim, chartis pretium quotus arroget annus,

writer who died a hundred years ago, ought to be called
ancient and therefore perfect; or is he merely modern
and therefore worthless? Let us set a limit to this
period of ripening and so end all disputes about
greatness.''

''Well ¹¹, you say, ¹¹ we will call any author who
died a hundred years ago a veritable ancient and
therefore a classic. '¹

''Very good ¹¹, l reply, '¹ then an author who has
been dead less than a hundred years by so much as
one month or one year, where shall he be put, among
the ancient and perfect or among the modern and
worthless ‚³¹¹

”Why surely ¹¹, you reply, '¹ he who misses the
antiquity of perfectiori by merely a month, or even by
a year, may still be properly ranked among the ancient
and great. '¹

Π l accept your exception, thank y0u; and now, like
the man who bared the horse's tail by pulling one hair
at a time, l take away this one year from the hundred;
and then l take another, and another; until the man
who calculates greatness with the help of the calendar
and says merit comes by a mere multiplication of years,
and admires nothing until death has set on it his seal
of approval, finds his standards of measurement have
diminished to mere zero.'¹
