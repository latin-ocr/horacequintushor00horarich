12 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Α man who continually awaits that favorable day
when he will begin to live rightly is like the stupid
peasant who stood on the bank waiting till the stream
he would cross had all run by! And the stream runs
on and on, and will never cease to run.

Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis: at ille
Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum.

Do you say, Men are eager to get money; they
want a rich wife to be the mother of their children;
they are keen to buy land and then to turn its virgin
forests into cultivated fields .3 But after all, enough is
enough, and he who has enough is wise if he does not
ask for more. Α house, a farm, and a store of gold, these
never drove the lever from their owner's aching body,
or took the burden of care from his mind. Verily, the
man of wealth must have good health if he would enjoy
the fruit of all his labors.

lf a man is bound by greed or harassed by lears,
his house, his home and all his possessions will give him
no more pleasure than paintings do the blind, warm
blankets the {everish or music the deaf. ln an unclean
pitcher sweet milk soon turns sour.

Sincerum est nisi va5‚ quodcumque infundis acescit.

And so l say, take your pleasures easily ; for bought
at the eost of health of mind or body they are not
worth the price.
