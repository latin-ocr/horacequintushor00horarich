TO MAECENAS

ΤΗΕ FlRST LETTER OF ΤΗΕ. FIRST BOOK

This letter was written to serve to some extent as an
introduction to the first book of Epistles. Horace had pub-
lished his three books of Odes and had apparently decided

not to do any more work of that kind. Maecenas, however,
urged him to continue, and he now protests against this plea,
though later he yielded and published a fourth book of Odes.
The letter was written Β. C. 20, when Horace was about
45 years of age. ”ln this Epistle‚'' says Davidson,¹' Horace
d scovers the same fine taste, as a philosopher, that he does as
a Poet. Of all the parts of Philosophy, morality was his chief
Study because every other part comparatively speaking is but
an idle speculation and fruitless curiosity. . . The Poet con-
cludes the letter with a satirical Reflection on the Stoicks, to
which the Surprize gives a great deal of Wit and Beauty. ln

Prima dicte m³hi‚ summa dicende Camena,
Spectatum satis et donatum iam rude quaeris,
Maecenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo.

You were the subject, Maecenas, of my earliest songs
and you will be the theme of my latest; but now you
ask me, a poet sufficiently approved and holding the
badge of retirement, again to enter the old game.

My age is not the same, nor my inclination.

Non eadem est aetas, non mens.
