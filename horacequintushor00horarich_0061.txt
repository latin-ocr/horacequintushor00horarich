The Second Leller of the First Book Ι Ι

We men today, we are born only to swell the
census! and live only to consume what the earth

Nos numerus sumus et fruges consumere nati,

provides! We are like the idle suitors of Penelope;
we are useless drones; and, like the young companions
of that luxurious prince Alcinous, we pamper our bodies
and boast that we can sleep till mid-day and then call
on music to help prolong our slumbers!

Bandsts, forsooth, arise from sleep in the middle of
the night that they may cut the throats of honest men;
and will not you arouse yourself even to save your own
life? Well, if you will not live wisely while health
remainS, be sure that you will hasten to be wise when
the dropsy seizes you.

And what is true of the body is true also of the
soul; for, if you do not wake early, and call for a
light and a book, and set your mind to studious work
and on wholesome thoughts, you will toss sleeplessly,
tormented by evil ideas and passions.

Tell me, why are you so anxious to remove from
your eyes something which may hurt them, yet are so
ready to put off, year after year, the mending of your
‘morals ἶ)

Come, come, my friend, well begun is half done.
Dare to live wisely‚ begin.

Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet: sapere aude;
Incipe.
