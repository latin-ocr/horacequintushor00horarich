TO LOLLIUS MAXIMUS

ΤΗΕ. SECOND LETTER OF ΤΗΕ FIRST BOOK

With Homer's stories of the Trojan War and of the
Wanderings ol Ulysses as texts Horace here talks ol the virtue
of sels-control and its rewards; of the slight value of worldly
possessions compared with health of mind and body, and of
early training in right conduct.

Lollius Maximus, to whom the letter is addressed‚ was a
young man who had served in the army under Augustus. When
this letter was written he was in Rome studying oratory. He
wrote another epistle to him about *three years later, which
showed that Lollius was ambitious to enter political life and live
among the great. The date of this letter is 23 Β. C. when
Horace was sorry-two.

Troiani belli scriptorem, Maxime Lolli.
Dum tu declamas Romae, Praeneste relegi.

While you are ,studying and declaiming at Rome,
Dear Lollius, l am here at Praeneste, reading once
more the stories of the Trojan War and of the Wan-
derings of Ulysses. Their author shows us more
skillfully and more clearly than do those diffuse moral-
ists, Chrysippus and Crantor, what manner of life is
worthy, what base, what helpful and what harmful.
Unless you’ve something else to do, listen and l'll tell

you whyl think s0.

The story of the long-continued conflict between
Greeks and Trojans on account of the love affair of
Paris, tells ol the quarrels of foolish kings and foolish
peoples.

Praeneste was
a town in
Latium about
sixteen miles
from Rome.

Chrysippus was
one of the
greatest of the
Stoics; Crantor
a follower of

Plato.
