36 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Do the stars of themselves or by command roam and
wander? What obscures and what reveals the light of
the moon? For what does this discordant harmony of
nature seek and plan? And is Empedocles or the wit
of Stertinius the more foolish?

l-lowever, whether you are living on the fish you
murder or on leeks and onions pray receive Pompeius
Grosphus into your friendship, and if he asks a favor
grant it to him freely3 Grosphus will ask nothing but
what is right and just and the price of friends is low
when good men are in want.

Vilis amicorum est annona, bonis ubi quid dest.

That you may know the latest news at Rome, let ·
me add: The Cantabrian is defeated by the valor of
Agrippa, Armenia by that of Claudius Nero; Phraetes
on his knees has acknowledged the power and rule of

Caesar. Golden Plenty from a full horn has diffused
rich harvests throughout Italy.

. . . . aurea fruges
ltaliae pleno defundit Copia cornu.
