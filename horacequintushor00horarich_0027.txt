Introduction xi

Another thing which must interest the modern reader is the fact
that such moral essays,parables‚and preachings as' those of Horace
were sent to prominent men of the day; the Emperor. his minis-
ters. great lawyers and men of affairs, were apparently glad to
receive verse telling them to be good, to avoid avarice, to give
up ambition, to be honest and faithful to their friends, to lead a
modest life.

Such things are sent out to-day lrom the pulpit; but who
among our poets would dare address a minister oi state in per-
sonal hexameters telling him that the first step toward wisdom
is to avoid folly ἱ) There was a living interest in poetry and ethics
among the ancient Romans, or great Augustus would not have lelt
hurt that he himself did not get an epistle showing how persons
ought to behave.

F inally, as in his Satires and Odes‚Horace in his Letters reveals
often his own character and habits and history; so that all of
them sooner or later has some touch which awakens the
reader.

We trust that some of these things will be found and appre-
ciated by the· modern reader of the letters of our immortal
Augustam

ΤΗΕ ΞΑΒΙΝΕ FARM

Horace was living at his home in the Sabine valley during

a large portion of the time in which he wrote his letters. l-le
wrote at least one of them from this region. l-le describes
it in another letter (XVI) ; and he discusses the morals ol rural
life with his steward in Epistle XIV.
· So much ol his philosophy and his happiness depended on or
were interwoven with his Sabine life that we have felt justified
in presenting this particular background to our readers in some
detail. We shall not enter into the discussion, sometimes
acrimonious, of the discovery and early description of the
region; but pass at once to the modern situation.
