xii Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Most visitors to Rome travei up to Tivoli‚ called Tibur in
Augustan times, to see the Baths of Hadrian, and what is
called the villa of Horace. lt is doubtful if Horace ever really
had a house at T ivoli‚ but he stayed there often as the guest of
Maecenas.

About twelve miles above Tivoli is the Sabine region, where
he had his farm and his country home. The river Digentia runs
through the valley and empties into the Anio.

ln the summer oi 1910 we obtained the services of Signor
Loescher of Rome who sent a photographer to the Sabine
Valley. He uncovered and photographed the long-buried
mosaic pavement of the supposed villa of Horace, and obtained
other views of the more familiar points. some of which are
reproduced here. There are no other photographs oi modern
views of this region so far as we can find; though there are a
good many old engravings which reproduced it, somewhat
idealized, as it appeared one hundred years aga*

ln September. 1842, Mr. G. Dennis visited the Sabine F arm
and wrote a very charming description of his investigations of the
spot. His letter addressed to the Rev. Henry Hart Milman is
published in Milman's well-known edition of Horace's works.
Mr. Dennis's description fits in so well with the photographic
views which we have obtained of the valley of the Digentia that
we venture to insert it here ε

''lf you follow the banks of the Anio, eight miles above
Tivoli you reach Vico Varo—the Varia mentioned by the poet
as in the neighborhood of his Farm, and probably at that time

the nearest town.

'¹ lt is now a small place, standing on a steep rock, overhang-
ing the mad, and still preserving fragments of its ancient walls of
rectangular masonry. You presently leave the Anio, and enter

* The Italian government is again investigating this region.
