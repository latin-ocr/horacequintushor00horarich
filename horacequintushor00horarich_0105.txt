 

Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore:

Tu nihil admittas in te formidine poenae:
Sit spes fallendi, miscebis sacra profanis.

Ep. ι, 16

'Tis love of right that keeps the good from wrong:
You do no barm because you sear the thong ;
Could you be sure that no one would detect.
E'en sacrilege might tempt you. l suspect.
Conington
