TO ICCIUS

ΤΗΕ TWELFTH LETTER OF ΤΗΕ FIRST BOOK

To this same friend, Iccius, about to set out on a military
expedition to Arabia, Horace addressed Ode twenty-nine of the
first book. The present letter was written five years later, B. C.
20, when Iccius was in charge of the estates of Agrippa in
Sicily. Horace represents him as discontented with this position
because his work kept him from his philosophical studies; and
moralizes to the effect that one can keep an interest in the
higher things, even if he live in the rush of affairs. The letter
tells us also what were some of the problems which the philos-
ophers at that time were studying. The final and most human
part of the letter is the introduction of Pompeius Grosphus, a
rich Sicilian knight, to Iccius.

Horace once wrote a fine Ode to Grosphus, II, 16, which
indicates that his friend was well-to-do, but that the conditions
might change.

A random hour may toss to me
Some gffts, my friend, refused to thee.

A hundred flocks thy pastures roam:

Large herds, deep-uddered‚ low around thy home
At the red close of day:
The steed with joyous neigh

Welcomes thy footstep: robes that shine

Twice dipt in Afric dyes are thine.

To me kind fate with bounteous hand

Grants other boon ; a spot of land,
