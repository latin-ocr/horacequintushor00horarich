The Fourteenth Letter of the First Book “ 39

Come, now, and hear what breaks the harmony
between us. l who once was dressed with fine togas
and shining hair, whom you know to have pleased
rapacious Cinara without rich presentS‚ who drank pure
F alemian at noon time, now arn satisfied with a short
meal and a nap on the river-bank.

Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique ca-pflssI-w---ss

Quem scis inmunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,
Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni:
Cena brevis juvat et prope rivum somnus in herba:

l am not ashamed to have played the game, or now
to have broken off from the sports. F or now, no one
with envious eye disparages my pleasures, or poisons
them with their dislike and envy. The villagers smile
at me working over the turf and rocks.

You prefer to eat your daily allowance in the city
with slaves, and are eager to be in their company; yet
my shrewd body-servant here envies you the enjoy-
ments of my woods and flocks and garden.

The ox would love to wear the horse’s trappings;
the lazy farm horse thinks he'd like to plough3 but l
should say, whatever art any one knows how to
practice, let him stick to it.

Optat ephippia bos. piger optat arare caballus:
Quam scit uterque, libens, censebo, exerceat artem.
