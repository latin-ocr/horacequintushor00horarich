38 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

him happy who lives in town. Whenever the home of
another pleases one, he dislikes his own. Each one
foolishly lays the blame on an innocent place, when
really the fault is in the mind, which tries in vain to
escape from itself.

Yon, when you were a slave in town silently prayed
for the fields; now, as Steward, you long for the city
and its sports and baths. But, as you know, l have
always been consistent, and always left the farm in
sadness when some hateful business took me to Rome.

We like quite different things, hence this argument
between me and you. What you look upon as a desert,
as inhospitable wilds, those who feel as l do call
charming, and we hate what you think beautiful.

l see, the brothel and the ditty inns stir up your
longing for the city; you think this remote little corner

⁸¹¹ of mine will produce pepper and incense rather than
a, good hay3 and you say there is here no near-by tavern
⁰³· to furnish you with wine, nor any cheap flute girl to

the noise of whose notes you can'practice a clumsy
dance; besides, you have to work incessantly breaking
up the fields which have not been ploughed and look-
ing after the unyoked oxen and filling them with
gathered leaves. The river also adds to your labors
when you have no other work, for it has to be taught
by many an embankment to spare the sunny meadow

when the rains descend.

Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,
Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato.
