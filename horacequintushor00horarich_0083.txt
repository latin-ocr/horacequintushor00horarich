The Ninth Letler of the First Book 29

he urges me, in season and out of season, to find an
opportunity of presenting him to you, as one who
deserves the confidence of so wise and discriminating
a gentleman as the Emperor, he rates my influence
with you and my ability to serve him as l should
not venture to rate them myself.

l have begged to be excused for one reason and
another, but l was afraid, if l persisted in refusing, that
Ι might seem insensible to your kindness, hiding under
a pretended lack of power a real unwillingness to
oblige. Therefore‚ to avoid the appearance of a
greater fault, l have descended to the importunity of a
mere courtier.

So, if you will pardon my presumption on behalf of
a friend, allow me to commend the bearer to you as
one who is worthy in every way of your kindness and
consideration.
