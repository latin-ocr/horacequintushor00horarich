The story of
the Slender
Field Mouse.

Maecenas has
offered Horace
opportunities oi

. '¹ Si vis '¹ ait '¹ effugere istinc,
Macra cavum repetes artum, quem macra subisti.¹¹

riches of Arabia. You have often praised me because
l was modest in my demands. ln your presence l have
often called you father and patron, and was no more
sparing of my acknowledgments in your absence.
