Horace shows
that merit is not
recognized

until after death.

Not ιο in
Caesar's case.

5 6 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Yon—are bearing the heavy burden, Caesar, of many
and very serious affairs, and you are bearing it alone;
you are protecting Italy with your armies and you are
reforming its morals and improving its laws. Under
these circumstances, for me to take your time wsth a
long letter would be to sin against the common weliare.

Romulus, F ather Liber and Castor and Pollux were
admitted after death to the temples as Gods because
of their great and worthy deeds; but while they, being
still on earth, were subduing nature, improving the
human race, bringing civil wars to end, establishing
property in land and founding cities, they grieved
because they did not receive the respect and approval

Ploravere suis non respondere favorem
Speratum meritis.

they hoped for and their good deeds deserved. Even
Hercules, who killed the dreadful Hydra and destroyed
those other well-known monsters and thus accom-
plished the tasks which fate imposed on him, found that
envy could be overcome only by his death. Any man
who outshines all other men in power and valor,
arouses jealousy by his own excellence3 yet, no sooner
is he dead, than those who are jealous and envious of
him living, at once begin to venerate him.

Urit enim fulgore suo, qui praegravat artis
Infra se positas, extinctus amabitur idem.

But to you, Caesar, we give honors as soon as they
are due, while you are still with us; we set up altars
