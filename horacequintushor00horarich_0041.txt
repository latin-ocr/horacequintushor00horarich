Introduction xvii

He discusses literary subjects. and in his art of poetry lays down
rules which have received the approval ol succeeding ages. The
only really humorous letter is his good-bye to his book.

Throughout his letters are many wise sayings and unimpeach-
able moralities; more proportionately than in any of his
other works. The compilet of the Emblemata of Horace.
Vaenius, Antwerp 1612. drew a great number of his illus-
trations from the Epistles and we have reproduced some of
these. As we have stated in our former book. they represent
Roman life from the standpoint of the Dutch craltsmen of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. And they may give the
impression that Horace was very serious and rather preachy as
a letter-writer. This is not quite true; most of the letters are
short and none contain subtle problems or complicated
philosophy. They do not tax the mind. The modern reader
will probably say they are very dull. Yet they are not: though
perhaps the only convincing proof of this is obtained by con-
sulting the Latin text.
