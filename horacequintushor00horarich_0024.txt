x Horace: Quintus Horatius Flaccus

been to give the facts regarding the personality of the people to
whom the writings are addressedÍ¾ to tell of the time and occa-
sion of writing and supply the local, historical and mythological
references, also to keep the thread of the story and show the

connection of the reasoning.
All this has been done in the notes of various learned

editors, from Orelli, Dacier and MacLeane to Wilkin. But a
combination of these data with a somewhat embellished English
translation has not heretofore been attempted. It is impossible
to follow the connection and meaning of Horace in these days
without here and there extending the text and interpolating
explanation& To the ordinary translation there must be
some additions. With these and using as a basis a standard
translation we hope to give to the Letters a certain mode rnity
and life.

Horace's philosophy does not require much text and he often
repeats his views to the point of being tiresome,-when stripped
of his art. Hence it has seemed best to publish, at first at least,
only a portion of the letters, selecting those generally esteemed
as the best and most representative.

To the modern reader we feel sure there will develop some
interest in the work for reasons other than the merit of the lines.

Here is the picture of an amiable pagan striving earnestly to
find out the meaning of life. I-lis efforts are so persistent, so
sincere, so full of art, but yet in such narrow range that they seem
in a way pathetic. His views are to us now almost puerile in their
simplicity. Yet he uses his ethical ideals seriously in an effort to
fight the corruption oi the day and build up better citizens. He
attacks with simple morality exactly the same vices we are corn-
bating now with all the forces of philosophy, religion, education
and hygiene. After all, Horace's philosophy would be enough
if he were to add to it the idealism and higher religious feelings
of to-day.
