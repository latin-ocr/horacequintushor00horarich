xvi Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

The period of Horace's letter-writing was also one of great liter-
ary activity. Associated with three great patrons of the Muses,
Pollio, Messala and Maecenas, were groups ol major and minor
poets, as well as of rhetoricians‚ orators and writers of history.

Virgil (70 Β. C.-l9 Β. C.) finished his Aeneid; Tibullus
(B. C. 55-B. C. 19) and Propertius (Β. C. 5Ο-Β. C. 16)
wrote their elegies; Ovid had begun his career (Β. C. 43-
Α. D. 17) and Livy (Β. C. 59-Α. D. 17) was writing his
history. The custom of reciting compositions to an audience of
friends had been introduced by Pollio. Libraries and book-
shops were established and books were plentiful and fashionable.
There were many minor poets and historiam. some good like
Gallus and Varius, and many bad, and satirized by the successful.
The discussion of philosophy, and especially of ethical philoso-
phy, the celebration of great men and great deeds, the satire of
folly, and the praise of love were the themes on which, except
the last, Horace touched.

ln dramatic art alone there were no great things being done.
Pompey had built a permanent theatre Β. C. 59 and the Greek
and old Roman tragedies more or less modernized were pre-
sented. There was an attempt to create a Roman drama and
Horace in his Ars Poetica shows his interest in the development
of this form of literary art. But the great names 01 the Roman
stage, Ennius, Accius, Plautus, and Terence were of the past.
The comedy of Terence had degenerated ; coarse farces, cheap
vaudeville shows became popular and finally carne mimes and
pantomimes in which the stage reached its lowest level. All these
were still very popular in the Augustan period, and were often
referred to by Horace.

His letters are mostly concerned with the philosophy of life,
with encouragements to right living, the praise ol moderatim, the
danger of wealth,the unhappiness due to great responsibilities. He
writes also notes of invitation, of introduction and of lriendship.
