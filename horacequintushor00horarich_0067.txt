 

Dimidium facti qui coepit habet: sapere aude;

Incipe: qui recte vivendi prorogat horam.
Rusticus expectat dum defluat amnis : at ille
Labitur et labeiur in omne volubilis aevum.

Ερ. 1, 2

Come now, have courage to be wise: begin z
You're halfway over when you once plunge in:
He who puts off the time for mending, stands

Α clodpol! by the stream with folded hands.
Waiting till all the water be gone past:

But it runs on, and will. while time shall last.
Coningeon
