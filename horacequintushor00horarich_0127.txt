TO AUGUSTUS CAESAR

ΤΗΕ. FIRST LETTER OF ΤΗΕ SECOND BOOK

Mommsen calls the three epistles ol the second book ''the
most graceful and delightful works of all Roman literature* The
present epistle to Augustus has always, says Wilkin. been a
favorite one, and other editors assure us that it ought to be con-
sidered one ol the most valuable that has been left us. Pope
says that the epistle shows ”that Augustus prohibited all but
the best writers to name him.'' This is the position which
Horace here wishes him to do. lt is the only letter Horace
addressed to Augustus and it is probably the last one he wrote,
being Csslmposed about B. C. 13 when this author was fifty-two
years o .

It is usually supposed, on the authority ol Suetonius. that it
was written by imperial command: but it sounds to one now as
if the composition were rather urged upon Horace by the Poets’
Club of that day, for it is in effect an apology for the poets and
especially for the good poets who refused to write for the stage,
or for anything but just art's sake.

Horace praises Augustus, but not at all more than is deserved
and with no superlatives. F urthermore, he declines and not very
graciously to write any epic in praise of his Emperor. He
assures Augustus that he can not write good poetry of this kind
and adds that he will not write verse which will be used by the
store-keepers to wrap their perfumes and groceries in; and with
this declaration he ends.

Cum tot sustineas et tanta negotia solus

Res Italas armis tuteris, moribus orneS,

Legibus emendes: in publica commoda peccem,
Si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.
