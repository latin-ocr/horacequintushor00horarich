70 Horace : Quintus Horatius Flaccus

panting builder hurries along with his mules and por-
ters; the creaking machine lifts alost a stone or a huge
beam3 dreary funerals dispute the way with unwieldy
drays; here runs a mad dog; and here a sow all over
mire rushes by.

Co now and meditate over your canorous verses!

1 nunc et versus tecum meditare canoros!

The tribe of poets loves the groves and it flees the
cities; they are true clients of Bacchus who delights in
sleep and shade.

Scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus et fugit urbem,
Rite cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et umbra :

Would you have me sing amid this ceaseless uproar
and try here to follow along the almost effaced paths
of the Ancients?

lf a man of genius, who has chosen for his retreat
quiet Athens, who has spent seven years in study and
has grown old in books and careS, goes out into the
streets of that city meditating and as silent as a statue,
he thereby makes the people shake with laughter. If
they mock at this old dreamer in Athens, how can you
ask me to play the same part in Rome, or think that

ι amid the billows and commotions of the city l am able

The Mutua!
Admiration of
the Augustan
poets.

to connect words that will awake the sound of the lyre?

There were at Rome two brothers, a rhetorician
and a lawyer; they held such opinions of each other
that they bestowed on each other pompous eulogiums.
