Ι O Horace : Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Antenor of Troy urges that peace be gained by
surrendering Helen, the cause of the war. What does
Paris do? He foolishly refuses peace on such terms
even though it would make his rule sale and his life
happy.

Nestor is eager to quiet the quarrel between Achilles
and Agamemnom but love in the latter and anger
in both still keep their enmity alive. The leaders of
the Greeks give way to their passions, their followers
pay the penalty.

Quicquid delirant reges, plectunter Achivi.

Within and without the walls of Troy, treachery,
deceit‚ crime, lust and evil passions are loose among
men.

To show us, next, what courage and seli-control

⁰¹¹· can do, the poet sets before us the story of Ulyssses;

and tells how he, having subdued Troy, visits many
cities and studies their customs3 and while he strives
for a safe return for himself and his companions, endures
calmly many hardships and remains undaunted in the
face of perils that threaten to overwhelm him. l-le

. . adversis rerum immersabilis undis,

would not yield to the song of the Sirens; he refused
the wine ol Circe which would have made him, had
he drunk it as did his foolish and greedy companions,
the senseless slave in hideous form of a harlot mistress,
and compelled him to the life of a filthy dog, or of a
hog delighting in the mire.
