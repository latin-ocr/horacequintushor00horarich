He tells young
Piso th eeeeee
be no

mediocrity in
poetry.

84 Ηωιεε .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

O thou fi·-born of the hopelul youths, though you,
Piso, have ren trained in judgment by your father's
voice, and a: yoursell wise; yet remember this which
limpress uf you: ln some professions mediocrity
and tolerabl ndowments may properly be allowed:
an average .‹‚vyer for example, or advocate at the
bar is far frcr having the talent of eloquent Messala,
or the know ige of Cassellius Aulum yet he may be
held in esteo : but not gods, or men, give any indul-
gence to midling poets; for poetry, designed and
invented by roure [or improving our minds‚ if it comes
short ever s little of the top, must sink to the
bottom.

He who canot fence relrains from the contests of the
Campus Marus; and he who is unskillul with the ball,

or quoit‚ or hap, does not meddle· ith thern, lest the
ring ol onlocers raise a laug t him: but he
who knows nming of poetry¹ λ dares corrfpose. Why

not> He is {teborn and a gentleman; above all, pos-
sessed of an euestrian estate, and clear of every vice!
