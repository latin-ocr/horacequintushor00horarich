Introduction xiii

a valley which opens to the north. On a height which rises to
the right stand two villages, Cantalupo and Bardela; the latter
is supposed to be the Mandela, which the poet describes as
rugosus fr1'gore pagus ; and, certes, it stands in an airy position,
at the point ol junction of the two valleys. You soon corne to a
small stream, of no remarkable character, but it is the Digentia,
the gelidus rivus, at which the poet was wont to slake his thirst
—me quoties reficit—and which flows away through the
meadows to the foot of the said hill of Bardela—quem Man-
dela bibit. You are now in the Sabine valley, so fondly loved

and highly prized.

Cur valle permutem Sabina

Why would l exchange burdensome riches for my Sabine valley.

'¹ Α long lofty ridge forms the left-hand barrier of the valley. It
is Lucretilis. Sir John l-lobhouse says it is now called Campa-
nile—but every peasant will point you out '¹ Lucretile.'' lt has
no striking features to attract the eye—with its easy swells,
undulating outline, and slopes covered with wood, it well merits
the title of amoenus, though that was doubtless due to its grate-
tul shade, rather than to its appearance. Ere long you espy,
high up beneath the brow of the mountain, a village perched on
a precipitous grey cliff. lt is Roeca Giovane, now occupying the
site of the ruined temple of Vacuna, of which more anon.

'¹ Five or six miles up this valley bring you to the foot of a conical
height, on which stands the said town of Licenza; while still
loftier heights tower behind, from which the village of Civitella,
‚apparently inaccessible, looks down on the valley like an eagle
from its eyrie. ln the foreground a knoll erested with chestnuts,
rising some eighty or hundred feet above the stream, marks the
site of the much-sung F arm.

”This knoll stands at the bend of the stream, or rather at the
point where several rivulets unite to form the Digentia. Behind
