 

The First Leiter of the Second Book 65

the world, the temple of Janus closed, and Rome, under
your sway, become the dread of the Parthian.

..... Nec sermones ego mallem
Repentis per humum quam res componere gestas,
Terrarumque situs et flumina dicere et arces
Montibus impositas et barbara regna tuisque
Auspiciis totum confecta duella per orbem,
Claustraque custodem pacis cohibentia lanum
Et formidatam Parthis te principe Romam,

For neither would your majesty, great princeâ€š receive
my small songs nor will my modesty attempt a theme to write the
for which l have not the strength. Officious zeal is epicotCaesar's
troublesome to him to whom it is indiscreetly addressed, achievements.
especially when it takes the form of poetic verse. l
have no desire to be disgraced by issuing paltry works,
lest when I receive a recompense, l be put to the blush,
and later packed up with my poem in an open box, l
be carried to the street where drugs and perfumes ancl
pepper are sold and whatever else is wrapped up in
useless scribblings.

Horace declines

Ne rubeam pingui donatus munere et una
Cum scriptore meo capsa porrectus operta
Deferat in vicum vendentem tus et odores
Et piper et quicquid chartis amicitur ineptis.
