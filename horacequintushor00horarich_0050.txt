4 Horace : Quintus Horatius Flaccus

Are you swollen with love of praise? There are
certain remedies of philosophy which will have power
to restore you; the wise book being read three times
over with good intent. One may be jealous, irritable,
indolem, intemperate, sensual, yet he is still not so
savage that he cannot be tamed if he but lend a patient
ear to culture.

Invidus, iracundus, iners, vinosus, amator,
Nemo adeo ferus est, ut non mitescere possit,
Si modo culturae patientem commodet aurern.

The first principle of goodness is to fiee from vice,
and the beginning of wisdom is to be free from folly.

Virtus est vitium fugere et sapientia prima
Stultitia caruisse.

See with how much toil ol mind and body you try
to avoid such things as you think are great evils: a
small income, or a shameful defeat at the polls. As a
merchant you tirelessly travel to the furthest lndies,
flying over seas and rocks and through fire to escape
poverty; and do you not wish, then, to listen and leam,
and to trust to a wiser man so that you may cease to
care lor those things which now you foolishly admire
and covet?

What village or county-fair athlete would disdain to
be crowned at the great Olympiad‚ if he had the hope,
the sweet assurance, that he would gain without toil
