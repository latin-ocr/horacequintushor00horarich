TO HIS BOOK

ΤΗΕ ΤΨΕΝΤΙΕΤΗ LETTER OF ΤΗΕ FrRsT BOOK

This letter was written as an epilogue to the Epistles forming
the first Book, and Horace here addresses this book as if it were
a slave anxious to be free. lt was the custom, after a book
(volumen) was finished to roll it up and polish the ends with
pumice. If not for sale it was then put in a case and sealed or

locked.

This letter is a good specimen of the author's humor. Horace
here takes occasion also to speak a kind word of himself.

Vertumnum Ianumque, liber, spectare videris,
Scilicet ut prostes Sosiorum pumice mundus.

You, my book, seem to be stanng at Vertumnus and
JanuS‚ in the hope of course that you may be polished
up and put on sale by the firm of the Sosii. You hate
the restraints which please the modest3 you are in tor-
ment at being seen by lew3 you love the public eye
though not so brought up. Fly then to where you long
to be. But remember, once sent out you can never
return.

''What, wretched book that Ι arn, what have Ι
’ ἀοηε.)“ you will say when some one tears you up; or
you find yourself folded tight and thrown aside, by a
reader who is tired of you. But if l, a prophet, am
not, in my resentment over your departure, mistaken
about your fate, you will be liked in Rome only till

The Sosii
brothers were
well known
booksellers and
their shop was
presumably
near the statues
of Vertumnus
and of Janus.
