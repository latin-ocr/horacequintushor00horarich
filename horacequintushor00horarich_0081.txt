TO CLAUDIUS TIBERIUS NERO,
INTRODUCING SEPTIMIUS

THE NINTH LETTER OF ΤΗΕ FIRST 3001<

Tiberius was the step-son of Augustus and succeeded him as
Emperor. Horace here sends a letter to him introducing his
friend Septimius.

In Ode II, 6 Horace sends to Septimius an invitation to his
country home. The poem shows the intimacy and friendship of
the twohmen. Sir Theodore Martin translates the last two
stanzas t us:

There Jove accords a lengthen'd spring,
And winters wanting winter's sting,
And sunny Aulon's broad incline

Such mettle puts into the vine,

Its clusters need not envy those

Which fiery Falernum grows.

Thyself and me that spot invites,

Those pleasant fields, those sunny heights;
And there, to life's last moments true,
Wilt thou with some fond tears bedew—
The last sad tribute Iove can lend—

The ashes of thy poet friend.

We know little of Septimius except that he was a man of
character and position. The letter of introduction has been
often quoted as a model of tact and discreet yet genuine
commendation.
