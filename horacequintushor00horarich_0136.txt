 

64 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

those poets who prefer to trust themselves to the reader
of their books rather than risk the disdain of insolent
spectators. ln this way you will fill your Apollonarian
library with choice books and give poets contage to
frequent with greater zeal the green retreats of Helicon.

Verum age et his, qui se lectori credere malunt
Quam spectatoris fastidia ferre superbi,

Curam redde brevem, si munus Apolline dignum
Vis complere libris et vatibus addere calcar,

Ut studio maiore petant Helicona virentem.

It is worth while, to inquire what sort of men shall
be the guardians of your virtue so signalized in peace
and war,--a task too sacred for unworthy poets.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, qualis
Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique
Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae.

Your favorite writers, Virgil ancl Varius, do not
reflect dishonor on your judgment, nor on the bounty
which, with many praises from the giver, they have
received. The features of illustrious men are not better
expressed in statues of brass than are their manners and
minds by the work ot the poet.

if l had the capacity myself‚ l would not choose to
write these letters, which creep along the ground, rather
than attempt to describe your glorious deeds, the coun-
tries you have seen, the rivers crossed, the forts built on
the mountains, the barbarous kingdoms subdued, the
wars under your influence brought to an end all over
