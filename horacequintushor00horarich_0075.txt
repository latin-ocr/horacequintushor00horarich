The Sevenlh Leiter of the First Book 21

of the courts are bringing on fevers and unsealing wills.

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella forensis
Addueit febris et testamenta resignat.

When the first snows of winter cover the Alban Hills,
l am going down to the sea shore and again take good
care ol myself‚—l am going to wrap up well and read
books; after that, my dear Maecenas, il you permit,
when the spring breezes and first swallows come, your
poet will visit you again.

You have made it possible for me to take this
leisure, and you have done it in a pleasant way; not
like the Calabrian host who offered pears to his guest:

'¹ Eat heartily,'' says he.

'¹ l have had enough, thank you.''

'¹ Still, take as many as you can.''

'¹ You are very‘lrindst¹

'¹ If you will take some home they will please the
children.''

'¹ l am as much obliged as if I went away loaded.'¹

”As you like! What you do not take will have to
be eaten to-day by the hogs! ¹¹

The wasteful and foolish give away what they
despise and dislike, and by their gifts simply make the
recipients ungrateful. The good and wise man is ready
to help the deserving3 and he knows the difference
between merit and its counterfeit.

Vir bonus et sapiens dignis ait esse paratus,
Nec tamen ignorat quid distent aera lupinis.
