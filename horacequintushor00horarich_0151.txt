The four ages of man, the criticisms of the drama at Rome,
Β. C. 40. the praise of the poet as a Priest and Teacher, are
some of the parts which we select and commend to the Twen-
tieth Century reader; and we make our apologies to the Shade
oi Horace for appearing to mutilate and '¹ feature '⁸ a work of his
presumably careful hours. Yet he may forgive us for trying to
bring about that time oi which he speaks in addressing his book:

Cum tibi sol tepidus plures admoverit aures.

'When the temperate sun shall collect for you more hearers.''

lt is generally believed that the Ars Poetica was one of
Horace's latest works and was written shortly before he died.

Some are of the opinion that it was left unfmished and was
published posthumously.

Other very good authority (Wilkin) says that it was written
about the time of the Epistles ol the first Book (Β. C. 20)

when he was forty-five.

Iungere si velit et varias indicere plumas

If a painter try to join the neck of a horse to the body
of a man, or to put various kinds of feathers on miscel-
laneously assembled limbs; to make, tor example, a
woman, beautiful to the waist, end in the tail of an ugly
fish, would you not smile as you looked at the result?

Believe me, dear Piso, a book will be very much
like such a picture, if the ideas are confused and like
the night-mares of a sick man, have neither beginning,
or end in a coherent form.

lt often happens in serious and weighty productioris
that one or two brilliant patches which stand out widely
from the rest are inserted; as when the grove and

Horace argues
ior unity and
simplicity.

And against the
sensational.
