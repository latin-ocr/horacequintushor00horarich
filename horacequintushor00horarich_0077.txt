Small things become persons of small condition. lt
is not imperial Rome which charms, but quiet Tiber
and the unwarlike Tarentum.

Parvum'parva decent: mihi iam non regia Roma,
Sed vacuum Tibur placet aut inbelle Tarentum.

The story goes that when that ornament of the bar,
the famous and successful Philip, was returning from
his office at about three o'clock and complaining, on
account of his age, about the long walk from his home
to the Forum, he saw a certain freedman sitting alone
in a barber-sh0p‚ composedly paring his nails.

'¹ Demetrius ¹¹, be says,—Demetrius is his foot-boy
who executes his commands with great skill‚—'' Co
and find out where that person lives3 who he is; what
is his fortune; who was his father and who is his
patron.'' ’

The boy went and returned, saying, ¹¹ His name is
Vultius Mena. He is a clerk with a small income, but
of good repute. He knows how to be active or idle
as occasion demands, how to get and how to spend.
He takes delight in modest companionship in his home;
in seeing a play, or, after business is done, in taking a
walk on the campus.''

Praeconem, tenui censu, sine crimine, notum
Et properare loco et cessare et quaerere et uti,
Gaudentem parvisque sodalibus et lare certo
Et ludis et post decisa negotia campo.
