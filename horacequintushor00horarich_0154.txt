The youth.

The man.

Old age.

82 Horace: Quintus Horatius Flaccus

matched at play with his fellows, is easily provoked,
or appeased, and changes every hour.

The beardless youth, having at last got rid of his
guardian, is happy with his horses and dogs, and in
the sports of the sunny campus; his mind, like wax, is
solt and easy to be formed to vice, froward to his
reprovers, slow in providing for the needs of life,
lavish of his money, high-spirited, amorous, and hasty in
abandoning the objeets of his love.

lnberbis iuvenis, tandem custode remoto

Gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi,
Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper,

Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris,

Sublimis cupidusque et amata relinquere pernix.

Our inclinations changing with our yearS, the temper
of middle life is eager in pursuit of riches, and seeks
to multiply friends, is ambitious of honour, and cautious
of venturing on an action which soon might need to be
undone.

Many infirmities beset old age; either because an old
man is too anxious for gain, and yet pinches liQimself,
and is afraid to use his money; or because he does
everything with a chilled and listless spirit, being dilatory,
languid in hope, remiss, greedy of a longer lite, peevish,
apt to repine‚ praising ever the former days when he
was a boy, censuring and forever correcting those who
are younger than himself. Our flowing years bring
along with them many advantage5‚ many our ebbing
years take away.
