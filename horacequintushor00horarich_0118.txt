48 Horace .· Quintus Horatius Flaccus

insatiate thirst for money and fame, such a person
your wealthy friend loathes and despise8‚ even
though he is a much worse man himself. Or, if he
does not despise him, he nags him and, like an anxious
mother, wishes his dependent to be more prudent and
moral than himself. He tells him, what is pretty
nearly true: ¹¹ My wealth can stand some follies; do
not try to vie with me; your income is too small3 a
scanty toga becomes a prudent dependent3 so cease to
enter the lists with the rich.''

Arta decet sanum comitem toga:

When Eutrapelus wished to do mischief to anyone
he sent him expensive clothes3 for then, his victim, de-
lighted with his beautiful garments, conceives new plans
and hopes; lies in bed till day-light, neglects his proper
business for the harlot‚ and lives on the money he
borrows At last he has to turn gladiator or drive a
gardener's cart to market.

You should not pry into your friend’s secrets or
reveal what is told you even if you are drunk or he has
made you angry.

Arcanum neque tu scrutaberis illius umquam,
Commissumque teges et vino tortus et ira.

Do not commend your own amusements or find
fault with those of others. When your patron wishes
to hunt, do not stay at home and write poetry. By
such conduct the affection of the twin brothers
